<!--at least 4 paragraphs;
headings (titles) of level 1, 2 and 3, which are represented by <h1>, <h2> and <h3> tags;
a clickable image of your choice (you can use this link https://i.ibb.co/gTDZZT8/ALX-Logo-07.png image,
 or another one you find on the internet by using its full URL); and it may link to any URL online that you want.
 
 However, in order to start getting consistency throughout the website, all of the HTML files (index.html and tweets.html) must now have the same structure:

The <body> tag of all of your webpages must contain exactly three direct sub-tags in that order: <header>, <main> and <footer>
The <header> tag must contain an unordered list (the <ul> and <li> tags) of links (the <a> tag) to each of your webpages. As you may have understood, this will serve as a navigation for your website.
The <footer> tag must contain one paragraph with the sentence Made by <YOUR NAME> - <a href="<ANY LINK>" target="_blank">here</a>. The paragraph must be on a single line in your code (no line breaks), or the checker may fail.
The <main> tag must contain two direct sub-tags in that order: <article> and <aside>:
<article> contains the content of your webpage: texts, links, images, tweets, … This is the part of index.html and tweets.html that you have already written.
<aside> contains a single paragraph, just reading for now “placeholder to add comment thread later”.-->
